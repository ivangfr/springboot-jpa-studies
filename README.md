# springboot-jpa-studies

The goal of this project is to study `JPA Batch Processing` (i.e, insert/update/delete a set of records in a single command) and `JPA Locking`.

## Proof-of-Concepts & Articles

On [ivangfr.github.io](https://ivangfr.github.io), I have compiled my Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and articles. You can easily search for the technology you are interested in by using the filter. Who knows, perhaps I have already implemented a PoC or written an article about what you are looking for.

## Modules

- ### [jpa-batch](https://github.com/ivangfr/springboot-jpa-studies/tree/master/jpa-batch#jpa-batch)
- ### [jpa-locking](https://github.com/ivangfr/springboot-jpa-studies/tree/master/jpa-locking#jpa-locking)

## Prerequisites

- [`Java 21+`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- Some containerization tool [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com), [`Podman`](https://podman.io), etc.

## Start Environment

- Open one terminal and inside the `springboot-jpa-studies` root folder run:
  ```
  docker compose up -d
  ```

- Wait for Docker containers to be up and running. To check it, run:
  ```
  docker ps -a
  ```

## Useful Commands

- **MySQL**

  - Run `MySQL` interactive terminal (`mysql`)
    ```
    docker exec -it -e MYSQL_PWD=secret mysql mysql -uroot --database studiesdb
    ```
    > Type `exit` to exit
    
- **PostgreSQL**

  - Run `Postgres` interactive terminal (`psql`)
    ```
    docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -d studiesdb
    ```
    > Type `\q` to exit

## Shutdown Environment

- In a terminal, make sure you are inside the `springboot-jpa-studies` root folder;

- To stop and remove docker compose containers, networks and volumes run:
  ```
  docker compose down -v
  ```

## Running tests

- In a terminal, make sure you are in the `springboot-jpa-studies` root folder;

- The commands below will run the test cases of all modules. In order to run just the tests of a specific module check the module README;

  During the tests, [`Testcontainers`](https://testcontainers.com) starts automatically Docker containers of the databases before the tests begin and shuts the containers down when the tests finish;

  - **Using MySQL**
    ```
    ./mvnw clean test -DargLine="-Dspring.profiles.active=mysql-test"
    ```

  - **Using PostgreSQL**
    ```
    ./mvnw clean test -DargLine="-Dspring.profiles.active=postgres-test"
    ```
